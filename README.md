Hello!
Welcome to my learnings of Playwright.

You'll find many wonderful tests here,ranging from little beginner tests to more advanced frameworks, etc.

Please, feel free to take a look around. If you wish to run these on your local machine, you must install playwright through npm.

Check out playwright's official documentation to get started:
